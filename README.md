# House_Prices_Prediction
In this project we'll predict future house prices.We'll merge and combine data, then use it to train a random forest model. We'll use data from the Federal Reserve, along with house price data from Zillow. The model will predict if house prices will increase or decrease in the future. We'll measure error using backtesting.

This project can be customized to predict house prices in your metro area if you live in the US.
